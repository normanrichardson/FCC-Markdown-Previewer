# FCC-Markdown-Previewer

This was put together for the Front End Development Libraries course on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc21752981-84f1-47db-a786-eea26f47141e/front-end-development-libraries). 
The aim was to create a website to render markdown text. 
The application uses jQuery for updating the HTML elements and Bootstrap to create a responsive frontend.

A demo can be found [here](https://normanrichardson.github.io/FCC-Markdown-Previewer/). The unit tests can be run by selecting the "hamburger menu" in the top left and selecting the "markdown previewer" option.
