# [FCC-Markdown-Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)

This was put together for the Front End Development Libraries course on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries). 
The aim was to create a website to render markdown text. 
The application uses jQuery for updating the HTML elements and Bootstrap to create a responsive frontend.
